This repository contains code to reproduce the results in 
["Metropolized multiscale forest recombination for redistricting" (Autry et al., 2021)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/21M1406854?casa_token=4Ne0JGmKIcsAAAAA:bwR_MWUSB6jM7mjbfO4-ujNCiy8zoeMc-BAtphCcGDHD4CelHrYmtOV_LowumLZGbajrbOCKMCyA). This code was written for my research preliminary examination for the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington. 

- **main.R** runs the sampler for a single chain

- **configs.yml** sets configs for the sampler, including number of iterations and seed plan

- **src/** contains the implementation of the sampler itself
